# Visualization-Projects

This is a backtracking visualization project for the Leet Code questions N-Queens

The program is written in java and utilizes the swing tool to create a graphical user interface

Running the program from the command line will result in a series of instructions being printed out
regarding bounds for input board dimensions

To properly observe how the backtracking function operates, it is recommended to input an integer between 
6 and 12

If the user inputs a number below one or above 20, the program will run on as a regular size chess board with
width and height 8
